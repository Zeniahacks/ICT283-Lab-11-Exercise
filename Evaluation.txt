ICT283 Assignment 2 - Progress Evaluation
Student Name: [Ang Kai Jun Elson]
Date: [18/11/2025]

1. MENU OPTIONS IMPLEMENTATION:
- All required menu options (1-6) have been implemented and are functional
- Option 3: Pearson Correlation Coefficient calculation working with user input
- Option 4: Monthly statistics with MAD calculation implemented and outputs to CSV
- Robust error handling for file I/O and user input
- Data validation prevents crashes from malformed input

2. BACKUP STRATEGY:
- Using Git for version control with regular commits
- Remote repository on [GitHub/GitLab] for off-site backup
- Daily commits with descriptive messages
- Branch strategy: main for stable code, develop for features

3. MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS SATISFACTION:
- BST implementation: Complete with recursive operations and function pointers
- Map data structure: Custom Map wrapper implemented (eligible for bonus)
- Statistical functions: Completely decoupled from weather data types
- File I/O: Robust parsing handles edge cases (blank lines, malformed data)
- Menu system: Fully functional with all required options

4. CUSTOM MAP CLASS (Bonus Eligibility):
- Minimal but complete interface (4 essential methods + iterators)
- Template design allows reuse with any types
- Encapsulates std::map while providing clean abstraction
- Defensible design: Only essential map operations provided

DESIGN JUSTIFICATIONS:
- BST Choice: Efficient for date-based queries and maintains chronological order
- Map Choice: Fast O(1) month-based data retrieval, natural grouping of data
- Statistical Decoupling: Functions work with any numeric data, not just weather
- Template Design: Maximum code reuse and type safety

LESSONS LEARNED:
- Importance of robust error handling for file parsing
- Value of decoupled statistical functions for testing and reuse
- Benefits of minimal interfaces in custom data structures
- Need for comprehensive input validation in user interfaces

CURRENT PROGRESS:
- All core functionality implemented and tested
- Code builds without warnings with C++11 and strict settings
- CppCheck analysis shows no critical issues
- Ready for demonstration and further development
