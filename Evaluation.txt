Student Name: [Ang Kai Jun Elson]

1. MENU OPTIONS IMPLEMENTATION:
- All 6 menu options fully implemented and tested
- Option 1: Robust file loading with error handling for malformed data and missing files
- Option 2: Complete data display using BST in-order traversal
- Option 3: Pearson Correlation Coefficient calculation with month validation
- Option 4: Monthly statistics with Mean Absolute Deviation implemented, outputs to CSV in exact format
- Options 5 & 6: Data structure info and clean exit functionality
- Comprehensive input validation prevents crashes from invalid user input

2. BACKUP STRATEGY:
- Git version control with daily commits and descriptive commit messages
- Remote repository on GitHub for off-site backup and collaboration
- Branch strategy: main branch for stable releases, feature branches for development
- Regular pushes to remote repository to prevent data loss

3. MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS SATISFACTION:
- BST Implementation: Complete with recursive insert/search, multiple traversal methods, and function pointer support
- Custom Map Class: Fully implemented with minimal interface (insert, contains, at, iterators)
- Statistical Functions: Completely decoupled from weather data types using std::vector<double>
- File I/O: Robust CSV parsing handles edge cases (blank lines, insufficient columns, malformed data)
- Data Validation: Comprehensive date validation and numerical value checking

4. CUSTOM MAP CLASS (Bonus Eligibility):
- Minimal interface with only 4 essential methods: insert, contains, at, and size
- Template design provides type safety and reusability across different data types
- Encapsulates std::map while maintaining clean, focused abstraction
- Iterator support for range-based operations while maintaining minimalism
- Defensible design philosophy: Only includes operations essential to map functionality

DESIGN JUSTIFICATIONS:
- BST Choice: Optimal for chronological data organization, efficient O(log n) operations, and natural date-based sorting
- Statistical Decoupling: All statistical functions operate on std::vector<double>, making them reusable for any numerical analysis
- Template Architecture: Bst and Map templates provide maximum code reuse and type safety
- Function Pointers: Enable flexible traversal strategies without modifying core BST logic
- Error Handling: Multi-layer validation at file parsing, user input, and data processing stages

PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED AND SOLUTIONS:
- Pointer Invalidation: Initially stored pointers in monthly map, but BST rebalancing caused invalidation
- Solution: Implemented direct BST traversal with function pointers for monthly data retrieval
- Column Index Mismatch: CSV format had different column ordering than expected
- Solution: Added debug output and corrected column indices based on actual CSV structure
- Data Validation: Malformed CSV lines caused parsing failures
- Solution: Implemented comprehensive error handling with try-catch blocks and validation

LESSONS LEARNED:
- Importance of defensive programming with extensive input validation
- Value of decoupled statistical functions for testing and reuse in other projects
- Benefits of template-based design for code flexibility and type safety
- Need for careful pointer management in complex data structures
- Advantages of function pointers for implementing flexible traversal strategies

TESTING AND VALIDATION:
- Successful processing of multiple CSV files with different date ranges
- Correct handling of edge cases: blank lines, malformed data, insufficient columns
- Statistical output verified against manual calculations for accuracy
- Seasonal patterns in output data match expected meteorological trends
- All menu options tested for functionality and error conditions

CURRENT PROGRESS:
- All core assignment requirements fully implemented and tested
- Code compiles without warnings using C++11 with strict settings
- CPPCheck static analysis shows no critical issues or security vulnerabilities
- Output formats match exact specification requirements
- Ready for final demonstration and submission

FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS:
- Potential for BST balancing algorithms to optimize performance
- Additional statistical analyses could be easily added due to decoupled design
- Map class could be extended with more operations if needed for other use cases
- Support for additional weather parameters could be added with minimal changes
